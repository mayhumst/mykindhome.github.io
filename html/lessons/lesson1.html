    <h1 class="lesson-title">Lesson 1: Photosynthesis</h1>

    <p>Photosynthesis is a process that plants use to make their own food. Just like how we need to eat food to get energy, plants need to make their own food to grow and survive.</p>

    <p>Photosynthesis happens in a part of the plant called the <b class="green-word">chloroplasts.</b> These are like little factories that work to make food for the plant. The chloroplasts take in sunlight to use for energy.</p>

    <p>Plants also need <b class="blue-word">water</b> and a gas called <b class="blue-word">carbon dioxide</b> to make their food. They get the water from the soil through their roots, and they get the carbon dioxide from the air around them.</p>

    <p>When the chloroplasts capture the energy from the sun, they use it to turn the carbon dioxide and water into a kind of sugar called <b class="green-word">glucose.</b> This is the plant's food! The process also releases oxygen into the air, which is great for us and other animals to breathe.</p>

    <h3 class="orange-word">So why is photosynthesis important?</h3>

    <p>Plants are living things that need food to grow and stay healthy, just like you and me. However, instead of going to the grocery store or eating food that someone else made, plants make their own food!</p>

    <p>Firstly, it helps plants <b class="blue-word">grow big and strong.</b> Just like how you need healthy food to grow and be strong, plants need their own healthy food to grow big and strong too. Without photosynthesis, plants would not be able to make their own food and would eventually die.</p>

    <p>Secondly, photosynthesis <b class="blue-word">helps keep our air clean.</b> When plants make their own food, they release <b class="blue-word">oxygen</b> into the air. This is the same gas that we need to breathe and stay alive. In fact, the oxygen that plants release during photosynthesis is the <b class="blue-word">main source of oxygen in the air we breathe!</b></p>

    <p>Finally, photosynthesis is important because it <b class="blue-word">helps support life on Earth.</b> Plants are the foundation of many food chains and ecosystems. They provide <b class="blue-word">food and shelter</b> for animals, which in turn provide <b class="blue-word">food and resources</b> for other animals. Without photosynthesis and the plants that use it, many living things on Earth would not be able to survive.</p>
