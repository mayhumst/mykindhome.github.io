MyKindHome is an ongoing project dedicated to introducing the principles of conservation and environmental education to young audiences. Our website hosts minigames, lessons, and activities for kids and is designed to be used by educators teaching the new generation about our climate and environment.

Although github pages is a static website host and cannot accommodate dynamic actions like form submission or database access, we wrote the framework for dynamic action with PHP and MySQL to allow users to sign in and store the information in a MySQL database (@jijkenbuuz). The rest of the site was built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, including some interactive elements like minigames (@mayhumst) and a large interactive game built with the p5.js library (@delaneyywong).
